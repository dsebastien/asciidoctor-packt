== Examples
=== Writing for Packt with Asciidoctor

In this chapter, you'll learn:
. How to create a Packt manuscript using `asciidoctor` (http://asciidoctor.org)
. How to write your text calmly, and let the tools do the layouts for you.
. How to embed images, source code, and create bullets, notes, etc.
. Über easy ways to write your next book (and even use ü's!)

==== Admonitions

NOTE: This is for notes. They are mapped to *Information Box [Packt]*

Break...

TIP: Tips that are side items and break out of the flow of the main text. Mapped to *Tip [Packt]*

...things...

WARNING: Warning - Red alert! Put inside a *Information Box [Packt]* and then wrapped in *Italics [Packt]*

...up...


CAUTION: Same as warning.

...or they'll...

IMPORTANT: HIGHLY important. *Tip [Packt]* with *Italics [Packt]*

...run together in a single chunk in LibreOffice.

==== Quotes

I decided to add quotes. There seemed to a lot of proverbial good ones bubbling up regarding Spring Boot, the topic of this
endeavor. So I needed a way to wrap them up properly. It turns out that I preferred the verse over quote, so that's the styling
I have implemented support for.

[verse, Dan Allen]
If Markdown is a 1st-grader, then AsciiDoc is a PhD student.

This one simply has the text, wrapped in quotes, followed by a long dash and the speaker's name.

[verse, Greg L. Turnquist, http://blog.greglturnquist.com/2014/05/asciidoc-springboot-packtpub-awesome-tool-chain.html]
After writing gobs of documents over the past year with AsciiDoc, I was strongly motivated to make that work as I embark on writing Learning Spring Boot.

If you want to cite the source, add the third clause. It will be appended to the end after a ",". NOTE: There is no additional formatting applied, like URL types. Instead, the entire block is marked up with Packt's QUOTE style. Hence, you might want to
debate if this is REALLY needed.

==== Code

Nothing is complete without looking at code.

[source,java]
----
include::samples/app.groovy[]
----

This chunk of code is Groovy (http://groovy.codehaus.org). It contains the `@RestController` to flag the entire class as being a controller that
returns values directly back to the client, without invoking any views.

Every line of a code listing is marked **Code [Packt]** except the last. It's marked **Code End [Packt]**.

==== Console outputs

Create a listing block, but don't prefix it with a source flag, and this backend will instead mark it up with **Command Line[Packt]**.

----
$ asciidoctor -T slim -b packt README.adoc
$ xmllint -format README.fodt | tail -10
      <text:p text:style-name="Normal_20_5b_PACKT_5d_">This README page is structured in the theme of Packt. It might not render perfectly on GitHub, but when viewed through a text editor,
and certainly when converted by this backend to LibreOffice, it should provide a nice example of writing a manuscript for Packt.</text:p>
      <text:p text:style-name="Normal_20_5b_PACKT_5d_">Be advised, the nature of this doc is Packt-like, but don’t assume it represents the proper formatting of a book. This is how to
style things. Formatting governs what sections you’ll have in a chapter. When to use tips, quotes, etc. is strictly editorial and
YOUR responsibility.</text:p>
      <text:p text:style-name="Normal_20_5b_PACKT_5d_">NOTHING is done to make it look good on GitHub, because that is not the target. BUT…why waste a keen opportunity to document both
environments?</text:p>
    </office:text>
  </office:body>
</office:document>
----

Every line of a code listing is marked **Command Line [Packt]** except the last. It's marked **Command Line End [Packt]**.

==== Screen Text

Text seen on the screen must be wrapped with **Screen Text [Packt]**.

[options="header"]
|====
| Field        | Value
| `Group'        | `learningspringboot`
| `Artifact'     | `issue-manager`
| `Name'         | `Issue Manager`
| `Description'  | `Learning Spring Boot`
| `Package Name' | `learningspringboot`
| `Styles'       | `Thymeleaf'
| `Type'         | `Maven Project'
| `Packaging'    | `Jar'
| `Java Version' | `1.7'
| `Language'     | `Java'
|====
{empty}

This table contains embedded options picked from the screen as well as things typed in.

===== Subsections

Yes, we handle subsections, but so far, only levels 2-5.

* Level 2 is for the chapter number
* Level 3 is for the chapter title
* Level 4 is for major sections
* Level 5 is for sub-sections

It might be possible to go deeper, but I frankly haven't needed that yet.

NOTE: This doesn't apply to Packt Cookbook formats.

===== Tables

We sure do cover them. Tables are an integral part of writing any manuscript. Check out the
following table.

[options="header"]
|====
| Stuff         | Description
| `asciidoctor` | command line tool to parse your doc
| packt         | name of the backend to process this
| slim          | THE simplest templating language designed to output XML. See http://slim-lang.com
| **key word**  | threw in a keyword inside a table just for fun
|====
{empty}

==== Images

Images are embedded through base64 encoding. They are NOT linked to external files.

image::samples/cat.png[width="65%" height="30%"]

The backend also embeds a Layout[Packt] tag afterwards with the basename of the file.

NOTE: It's up to YOU to properly name the images according to Packt guidelines.

==== What are some of the things you don't cover?

Well, there are actually a lot of other styles provided by Packt not handled here. 

* Code-within-Tips
* Tips-within-Tips
* Bullets-within-Tips-within-Tips
* The entire appendix section of Packt's style guide.
* etc.

That is too much, and frankly, I don't much care for that stuff. Too detailed and really
pulls me away from writing, so I don't support it.
